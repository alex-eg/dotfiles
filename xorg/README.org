~.xinitrc~ executes its contents when an X session is started via
~xinit~. ~strartx~ is a frontend for ~xinit~, so this applies to it
too.

This ~.xinitrc~ contains lines to let know all GUI applications in the
session about fcitx input method.

~.Xresources~ contains urxvt config for color scheme (beautiful
molokai theme) and fonts.
