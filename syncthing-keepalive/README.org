*** Syncthing keep alive servie
    Very simple solution to make sure that syncthing is up and running
    at most times, and also accessible via automatically started
    screen session.

*** Prerequisites
   * syncthing
   * screen
   * cron

*** Usage
    Place ~check-syncthing.sh~ somewhere in you path, and add it's
    invocation to your crontab.

    You also might want to use the ~timeout~ utility, since the script
    contains while loops which in theory can stuck in an endless loop.

    So, your crontab entry for this script might look like this:
    #+BEGIN_SRC
    */10 * * * * /usr/bin/timeout -s 2 5 ~/bin/check-syncthing.sh
    #+END_SRC

    Also don't forget to make the script executable.

*** Known limitations
    * Doesn't clean pid file even after successfull shutdown.
