* userChrome.css
  Chrome [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Chrome][is Firefox UI]], and userChrome.css is a file for user UI
  settings. This particular setup removes tabs toolbar and sidebar
  header, which combines nice with the use of tree tabs extension.

  Place this file in ~/.mozilla/firefox/<your_profile>.default/chrome/ dir.
  If the dir doesn't exist, feel free to create it.

  Set ~toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets~ in Firefox
  ~about:config~.
