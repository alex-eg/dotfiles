* userChrome.css
  Chrome [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Chrome][is Firefox UI]], and userChrome.css is a file for user UI
  settings. This particular setup removes tabs toolbar and sidebar
  header, which combines nice with the use of tree tabs extension.

  Place this file in ~/.mozilla/firefox/<your_profile>.default/chrome/ dir.
  If the dir doesn't exist, feel free to create it.

  On modern Ubuntu the profile resides somewhere in ~/snap. Exact
  location can be found with about:profiles in Firefox itself.

  ~toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets~ must be set in
  Firefox ~about:config~ for this to work.

* user.js
  ~about:config~ settings, disabling telemetry, useless extensions and
  accessibility, which seems to consume a lot of resources. Put it
  into the profile directory.
  This file overrides entries in ~prefs.js~.
